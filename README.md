# ceproc

*ceproc* is short for complex event processor, an old fashioned idea revisited here in the form of a datalog language.   

The concepts and a syntax are given [here](engine.md)

In short, datalog is extended with a time dimension, effects and aggregates.  The aggregates are over semilattices and are computed alongside facts as *parafacts*.
