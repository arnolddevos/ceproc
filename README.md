# What is this?

The aim here is to develop a version of the datalog language for programs that continuously react to events in the environment and generate effects on the environment.  

# Isn't that Prolog?

It is not an aim to reinvent prolog. We want a purely declarative language that is not in itself Turing complete.

# Why?

It will be a better way to do realtime event processing and some forms of signal processing.
